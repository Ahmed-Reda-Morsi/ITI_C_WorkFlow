tricks in loops in c.
for(..;..;..);   
{
    ......
    ......
    ......
}
for block will execute only time after for condition fails.

==== nested functions ====
define a function within a function.
 	auto void sw(void);
		int b=10,c=15;
		 sw();

		void sw(void){
			int temp=b;
			b=c;
			c=temp;
			
		}
		printf("%d ||  %d",b,c);

/==========================================
pointer - pointer  is a valid operation 
	and return (pointerValue1 - pointerValue2)/step of type
	assume type is int step is 4 in pc.
	 therefore it return number ints between these to pointers.

but  operand (+) -> not valid.

------------------------------------ notes 11/3/2023---------------------------
you can change the entery point of a program from main to any function with startup code.
 
UML -> use cases

private function for a file (not allowed for any file to call it except it's file.)
	:you use (static) modifier in declaration (prototype)
 
you can change in static local variable in function from another function
	using return pointers

you can change in static global variable in file from another file
	using global pointers

int *ptr="hello" -> (ROM) (hello) store in  .rodata (also global constant)
				  can not modified.

int  arr[]= "ahmed" -> in RAM. can change.
